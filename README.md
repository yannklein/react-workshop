## Getting started

### 1. Setup the project

<details>
<summary>Open if you're not a Le Wagon student</summary>
You will need to install the softwares below if not done yet:

- Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or over

</details>

<details>
<summary>Open if you graduated more than 6 months ago</summary>
You need node v16 or over. Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
nvm install 16.15.1
nvm use 16.15.1
```

</details>
<br>
Follow these steps:

- In your terminal, **go to the folder in which you would like to build your react app**.

- Then, run the below code:

```bash
gh repo clone yannklein/react-workshop
cd react-workshop
rm -rf .git
cd ref
code .
cd ../workshop
git init
code .
rm -rf package-lock.json
rm -rf ./node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

It will open **2 VS codes!**:

- The `ref` one is the final code of this workshop (with the app built already) for your reference.
- The `workshop` one is the code base you will use to build your app during this workshop.

You should see this on your terminal:

<img src=image.png width='460' style='border-radius: 5px; margin: 16px 0;'>

- Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser, you should see this:

<img src=image-1.png width='200' style='border-radius: 5px; margin: 16px 0;'>

### 2. Setup the your code editor

#### Setup for VS code

Go to `Code > Preferences > Extensions`, search and install "Reactjs code snippets" (some [doc here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.ReactSnippets))

#### Setup for Sublime Text

1. Go to `SublimeText > Preferences > Package Control`, search for "Package Control: Install Package" and press Enter. In the appearing list, search for "Babel" and press Enter.

2. Same operations for "Babel Snippets" (some [doc here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel%20Snippets))

3. Got to SublimeText > Preferences > Key Bindings

Add the code of this link on the right side.

## Push your project to production with Github Pages

1. First decide of a Github repo name. Go to the `workshop/vite.config.js` file and replace the base folder with your repo name:
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "/your-repo-name-here/"
})

```

2. In the terminal, commit your work, create your gh repository and push your code:

Make sure you replace `your-repo-name-here` in the below command ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "finish the workshop base app"
gh repo create your-repo-name-here --public --source=.
git push origin master
gh browse
```

3. The github repo will open, your project should be building in the Action tab. Wait for a short while to see the URL appearing:
   
https://github.com/yannklein/react-workshop-feb2024/assets/26819547/cde3c3f3-6221-424d-8aa1-05b09ce9f458




## How was this boilerplate created?

The boilerplate has been create with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) a lightning fast Frontend framework builder.

To install Vite and create a react boilerplate, run the following code on your terminal:

```
npm create vite@latest
```

You will see a terminal step by step interface that will guide you through the creation process.

For this workshop, I used the following options:
- Project name: `react-workshop-feb2024`
- Select a framework: `React`
- Select a variant: `Javascript`

Then, run the sugggested 3 commands to start up the project.
